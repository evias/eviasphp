# eVias PHP library

This PHP library takes care of declaring the base abstraction layer my web applications
are build upon.

Some of the classes are used by the eViasWeb project (github.com/evias/eViasWeb) and are
developed in a way to improve the object relational mapping with my PHP classes.

Any of you whose wish is to contribute can send me an email at <saive.gregory@gmail.com>
